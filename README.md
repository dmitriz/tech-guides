## Code management

### SSH keys

To avoid using passwords that are generally insecure, you can instead use [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) based [Public Key authentication](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication) for easy password-less code transfer between your computer and remote repositories on Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket.

To set up, you need two simple steps:
1. Generate ssh key on your computer.
2. Add your key to Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket.
